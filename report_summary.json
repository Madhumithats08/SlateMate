  "overview": {
    "description": "This report summarizes the results of the content safety analysis performed on social media metadata as part of the SlateMate AI/ML technical assignment. The classifier evaluated 100+ social media posts and labeled them as Safe, Neutral, or Unsafe, using a combination of natural language processing (NLP), keyword-based detection, and simulated image analysis."

  "insightsAndObservations": [
    "The classifier was able to accurately flag posts with explicit or emotionally harmful language using Detoxify and keyword matching.",
    "Emotion detection using TextBlob helped flag emotionally risky but low-toxicity posts.",
    "Although image content wasn't available, simulated image analysis was integrated to reflect the potential of multimodal moderation.",
    "Most unsafe posts involved hate speech, self-harm references, or suggestive/violent visuals."
  ],
  "finalThoughts": "The current feed contains a notable percentage (27%) of unsafe or emotionally harmful content. This level of exposure could pose risks, especially for young or vulnerable users. The developed AI-powered classifier provides a foundational moderation engine and can be further enhanced by integrating real-time image processing, multilingual support, and advanced emotion modeling.",
